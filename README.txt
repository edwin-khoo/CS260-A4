Try to be as abstracted as possible
Naming convention to be decided
Standard set to C++17 W4

To Push: Clean and rebuild solution first. Then check to see
if there are any errors or warnings. If they don't belong to
you then alert the owner immediately. Try to commit only when
there are no warnings or errors. 

Do not use filters. Enable all files mode and organize
with folders

Do not touch files that don't belong to you unless they give
permission for it.

Have file headers for each file you create so submission crunch
won't include headers

To indicate any future work mark the chunk with
//[TODO <initials>: <task>]
for easier future access
